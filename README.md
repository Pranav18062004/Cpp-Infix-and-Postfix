# Infix and Postfix Expression Evaluation Using Stack

In computer science and mathematics, solving arithmetic expressions, particularly infix and postfix notations, is a common operation. To evaluate these expressions, we often use stacks. In this README, we'll explain what infix and postfix notations are, and how to evaluate them using stacks in C++.

## Infix Notation

Infix notation is the standard way we write arithmetic expressions, where operators are placed between the operands. For example, the infix expression `(3 + 4) * 2` means "add 3 and 4, then multiply the result by 2." Infix expressions can be challenging to evaluate programmatically because of operator precedence and parentheses.

## Postfix Notation

Postfix notation, also known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), is a more computer-friendly way to write arithmetic expressions. In postfix notation, operators come after their operands. For example, the infix expression `3 + 4` is written as `3 4 +` in postfix notation. Evaluating postfix expressions is easier because there is no need to consider operator precedence or parentheses.

## Implementing Infix-to-Postfix Conversion and Evaluation

To evaluate infix expressions, we often first convert them to postfix notation using a stack. Here's a brief outline of how to do this in C++:

1. **Declare Stacks**: Create two stacks - one for operators and another for the output (postfix) expression.

2. **Parse Infix Expression**: Iterate through each character in the infix expression, and for each:
   - If it's an operand, add it to the output stack.
   - If it's an operator, check its precedence and stack conditions to push it to the operator stack or pop operators to the output stack.
   - Handle opening and closing parentheses appropriately.

3. **After Parsing**: If there are operators left in the operator stack, pop and add them to the output stack.

4. **Postfix Evaluation**: Once you have the postfix expression, you can use another stack to evaluate it:
   - Iterate through the postfix expression.
   - For each element, if it's an operand, push it onto the stack.
   - If it's an operator, pop the required number of operands from the stack, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.

5. **The Result**: The final result on the stack after processing all elements will be the result of the expression.

## C++ Implementation

In C++, you can implement this algorithm for converting infix to postfix notation and then evaluating postfix expressions. The code can be more extensive, handling various operators and edge cases, but this basic outline will give you a starting point.

Remember that there are libraries and built-in functions in C++ for working with stacks and expressions, which can simplify the implementation of these algorithms.
